MAGIC is a regexp that matches all potential magic

is replaced by the result of calling the associated TRANSFORM
function. TRANSFORM is a function taking two arguments, the
character to be transformed and the rest of string after the
character. The function should return a triple (REPLACEMENT REST
. STOP) where REPLACEMENT is the replacement and REST is the rest
of the string that has not been transformed. If STOP is non-nil
then the substitution stops immediately.  The replacement starts
at position START, everything before that position is returned
literally.  The result is a pair (RESULT . REST). RESULT is a
list containing the transformed parts in order. If two
subsequents parts are both strings, they are concatenated. REST
is the untransformed rest string (usually \"\" but may be more if
TRANSFORM stopped the substitution). Which characters are
considered as magic characters (i.e. the transformation happens
if the character is NOT preceeded by a backslash) is determined
by `evil-magic'. The special tokens \\v, \\V, \\m and \\M have
always a special meaning (like in Vim) and should not be
contained in TRANSFORMS, otherwise their meaning is overwritten.

transformations, usually `regexp-quote' or `replace-quote'."
