;;; Commentary:

;; This file contains helper functions for writing tests for
;; evil-mode.  These helpers can also be used by other packages which
;; extend evil-mode.

;; To write a test use `evil-test-buffer':

;;     (require 'evil-test-helpers)
;;
;;     (ert-deftest evil-test ()
;;       :tags '(evil)
;;       (evil-test-buffer
;;        "[T]his creates a test buffer." ; cursor on "T"
;;        ("w")                           ; key sequence
;;        "This [c]reates a test buffer."))) ; cursor moved to "c"
;;
;; The initial state, the cursor syntax, etc., can be changed
;; with keyword arguments.  See the documentation string of
;; `evil-test-buffer' for more details.

  "Execute FORMS in a temporary buffer.
The following optional keywords specify the buffer's properties:

:state STATE            The initial state, defaults to `normal'.
:visual SELECTION       The Visual selection, defaults to `char'.
:point-start STRING     String for matching beginning of point,
                        defaults to \"[\".
:point-end STRING       String for matching end of point,
                        defaults to \"]\".
:visual-start STRING    String for matching beginning of
                        Visual selection, defaults to \"<\".
:visual-end STRING      String for matching end of
                        Visual selection, defaults to \">\".

Then follows one or more forms. If the first form is a string,
it is taken to be a buffer description as passed to
`evil-test-buffer-from-string', and initializes the buffer.
Subsequent string forms validate the buffer.

If a form is a list of strings or vectors, it is taken to be a
key sequence and is passed to `execute-kbd-macro'.  If the form
is \(file FILENAME CONTENTS), then the test fails unless the
contents of FILENAME equal CONTENTS.  If the form is \(error
SYMBOL ...) then the test fails unless an error of type SYMBOL is
raised.  Remaining forms are evaluated as-is.
